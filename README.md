# Cryptocurrencies
This project will use unsupervised machine learning processes to discover patterns in the data.

## Purpose of this project
The purpose of this project is to assist my client, Accountability Accounting, in analyzing various types of cryptocurrencies. The analyzed cryptocurrencies will be introduced to customers of Accountability Accounting who would like to use a form of cryptocurrency other than bitcoin. The gathered data has been pre-processed and visualized to display the various types of cryptocurrencies, patterns in the different types, and predictions that can be made from the data. From the results of the machine learning model, we can see that some cryptocurrency coins have a large supply with minimal coin mining, such as TurtleCoin, and MoonCoin. These cryptocurrency coins can be provided to consumers of Accountability Accounts in order to help them make the best decision to choose the currency in which to invest.
